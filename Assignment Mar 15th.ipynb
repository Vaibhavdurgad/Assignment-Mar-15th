    "Artificial intelligence involves replicating human intellectual processes through machines, especially computers. There are many applications of AI, such as expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. EX:Facial recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces."
